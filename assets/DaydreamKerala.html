    <h2>Daydream Kerala:</h2>
    <h3>Sponsorship Invitation</h3>

  <div style="padding:30px;">
    <p style="white-space: pre-line;">Hi, I am Arun, a highschooler helping organize Daydream Kerala. It is a student-led 24-hour game jam for highschoolers across Kerala. Daydream is part of a greater global initiative powered by Hackclub. While hackclub events rarely happen here we want to change that by hosting this game jam where highschoolers come to build games from scratch in a beginner-friendly, inclusive space.Sponsoring Daydream Kerala directly supports venue costs, food, workshops, and prizes while connecting your brand to a passionate, underserved community of young makers. Your backing would spotlight Kerala’s talent, fuel local innovation, and offer visibility via event branding, social shoutouts, and mentorship access.We’d love to discuss how you can help us out.

For details, reach us at: [arungeorgesaji@gmail.com]

Warm regards,
Arun
On behalf of the Daydream Kerala Organizing Team</p>
