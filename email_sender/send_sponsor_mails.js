          <p>Namaste,</p>

          <p>We, a group of teenagers, are organizing Kerala's first in-person 24hr gamejam for high-schoolers - Daydream Kerala. </p>

          <p>This event is part of the larger umbrella of <strong>Daydream</strong> events organized by <strong><a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a></strong>. Hackclub is a non-profit organization empowering the largest community of high-school makers around the world to explore their creativity, build projects, and learn by doing. Hackclub is also backed by large groups and organizations like the <strong>Musk Foundation</strong> (led by Elon Musk) and <strong>Github Education</strong> (owned by Microsoft).</p> 

          <p>This is a unique opportunity for sponsorship and supporting young talent in Kerala. We're reaching out to see if you'd be interested in supporting this groundbreaking event.</p>

          <p>The challenge is simple - students build a fully-functional game from scratch in the span of a day. Each participant can team up with up to 2 other participants (3 people per team) to design, develop and ship a project.</p>

          <p>The event will take place at TinkerHub, Kochi. To give equal opportunities to all students across Kerala, we are planning transportation routes from North and South Kerala.</p>

          <p>For more information, view our detailed prospectus, you can also explore our official website:

          </p>

          <p>We would be happy to discuss more on the sponsorship opportunities and benefits. Please let us know if you'd be interested in supporting this initiative for young creators.</p>

          <p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
